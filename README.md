* Run `gulp stage` to combine HTML partials, convert SASS to CSS, and copy everything into the 'stage' directory
* Run `gulp watch` to run `gulp stage` then watch files in the 'dev' directory for changes and compile or move them into 'staging' as needed
* Run `gulp` or `gulp build` to compile, combine, and minify code into 'production' directory for distribution.

## Directory Structure

* **dev** - Development code - were all the editing takes place
	* **html** - HTML partials
	* **images** - Inline images used in HTML
	* **scripts** - Javascript files
		* **vendor** - Third party Javascript files
	* **styles** - SASS files
		* **fonts** - Web fonts files
		* **img** - Images used in SASS files
* **node_modules** - Generated from package.json
* **prod** - Compiled and minified code ready for production - generated by `gulp build`
* **stage** - Compiled code for testing - generated by `gulp watch` or `gulp stage`

## To Do
* If you add a new directory to 'dev' while running `gulp watch`, move it into 'stage'
* If you delete an HTML file, also remove it from 'stage'
